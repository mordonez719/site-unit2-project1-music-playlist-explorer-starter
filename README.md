### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed were very helpful and served as a good introduction to what I would need. The lessons did not show everything but they built a foundation that was beneficial.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have looked into my bugs. I ran into issues adding elements and was unable to display the playlist information. I hope to fix these bugs on my own to discuss with my manager after my first submission.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

In my group, I noticed that many of my peers faced similar issues as I did which was reassuring. However, their websites had more features and functionality. Next time, I would like to add more customization and interactive features like many of my peers did. The presented projects were very well fleshed out and I would like to have added such features.

### Open-source libraries used
